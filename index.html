  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I am an emerging multi-disciplinary designer and developer specializing in user-centered design. I have a unique blend of technical and creative skills that adds immense value to the current digital industry.</p>
	  <p>I am currently a Marketing and UX Designer intern for a local tech startup, <a href="https://tokenoftrust.com/">Token of Trust</a>, as well as a Digital Marketing Consultant for <a href="https://www.aquamedix.net/">Aquamedix.</a></p>
  <p>I am passionate about minimal designs, startups, and continuous self development.</p>

   <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
   <p>I was born in the South but raised in the Midwest. Yes, the winters are brutal but the beautiful summers and the friendly people make up for the below zero temperatures. (Sometimes).</p>
  <p>I have a bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota in Business and Marketing, Psychology, and Retail Merchandising and I recently obtained a Web and Interactive Media Certificate from Minneapolis Community and Technical College.</p> 
  <p>To continue my career transition from analyst to Front-End Developer, I am currently pursuing the Web Development Career Path at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/courses/web-development-career-path/">Thinkful</a>.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  	<p>Aside from design, I enjoy exploring new coffee shops and restaurants, traveling to warm places, developing my photography skills, reading about the latest fashion trends, and watching Shark Tank and Dateline.</p> 
  
  <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
  <p>I'm blessed to have the opportunity to pursue my dream job as a Front-End Developer where I get to use both my technical and design skills. But in another life-time, I think I would have enjoyed being an investigator of some sort.</p>
  
  <h2>What's your background?</h2>
  <p>I was previously a fraud analyst at a finance company for over 5 years when I finally left to pursue my passion. I loved fashion so I explored becoming a photo stylist. I enjoyed the amount of research and styling that went into a photoshoot but I was left feeling unfullfilled. Remembering how much I enjoyed manipulating the codes in my Myspace page in 2005, I've decided to enroll in a web design and development course in 2014 and have not looked back since.</p>

  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>My music playlist currently includes: Alessia Cara, The Weeknd, Adele, Troye Sivan, and yes, Justin Bieber. No shame.</p>
